## Understand what is refactoring (in child-friendly language)

Imagine you have a big box of Legos. You start building a castle with your Legos, but you just keep adding pieces wherever you want. After a while, your castle might look a little messy and it might be hard for someone else to see how you built it. Maybe you even have trouble finding where to add more pieces because it's so cluttered.

Code refactoring is like organizing your Lego castle. You don't change the castle into a spaceship; itâ€™s still a castle. But you might take some parts apart and put them back together in a neater way. You group similar pieces together, make sure all the parts are easy to get to, and maybe even make some parts of the castle stronger. This way, your castle looks better, it's easier for others (and for you!) to see how it's built, and you can easily add more pieces to it later.

So, code refactoring is just making your computer code cleaner and organized without changing what it does, just like tidying up your Lego castle without changing that it's a castle.
